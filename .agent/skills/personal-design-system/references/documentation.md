# Documentation

## Goal

Maintain one clear source of truth for usage and decisions.

## Minimum Docs Set

- Token naming rules
- Component API reference
- Variant and size behavior
- Do and don't examples

## Rules

- Document intent, not only implementation.
- Update docs when token names or component APIs change.
- Keep examples aligned with current semantic token model.
